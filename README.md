# Currency Converter 

A currency converter GUI app developed with python and tkinter.

This application is created by me to convert currencies by inputting two 
currency codes and clicking the "Convert now" button. 

This application used the Exchange Rates API to receive the converted result and 
users are able to manipulate the output result by inputting a certain amount to be converted,
and set a historical date. 

The user can click on the history button to check their past pairs of currency code converted that are in a 
form of a button in another GUI and they are able to click on one of the buttons to be input the pairs of codes 
into the main GUI again to be used as conversion.

The user can also click on the date checkmark to have a historical rate when converting currencies. The user can also 
click the "Set date" button to set a past date for a historical rate they want in another GUI.  

This projects imports the tkcalendar and requests modules and you will need to install both of 
these modules to use this GUI application.
